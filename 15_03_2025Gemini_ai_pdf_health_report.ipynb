The slightly low sodium levels warrants further investigation.

            " The provided lab report does not offer a diagnosis.  It only presents the results of various tests.  The elevated ESR (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second hour) and slightly elevated Widal test titres for *Salmonella Typhi* (O: 1:160, H: 1:80) suggest *possible* typhoid fever, but this requires clinical correlation by the physician.  The other results are mostly within normal ranges.  A diagnosis can only be made by a doctor considering these results in conjunction with the patient's symptoms and medical history.\n",
